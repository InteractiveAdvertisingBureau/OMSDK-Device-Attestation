# OM SDK Device Attestation

## In Progress

OM SDK Device Attestation helps address a fundamental vulnerability in CTV and mobile advertising: the misrepresentation of device information. Also called device spoofing, where bad actors falsify device information to appear as premium inventory, this leads to wasted ad spend for buyers and lost revenue for sellers. The Device Attestation capability in OM SDK enables buyers to independently verify that they are buying genuine CTV and mobile inventory from sellers, thanks to privacy-preserving attestations made by device manufacturers for their devices. This adds another valuable signal that can strengthen the industry’s ability to detect and prevent device spoofing.
